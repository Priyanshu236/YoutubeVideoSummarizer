your friends are scrolling through shortcontent but you my friend you're here tolearn welcome to the honest Clips thefirst question is about this one TempleI've heard about in Kerala I believeit's called the padmanabhan templeplease correct me if I'm wrong butthere's supposed to be a door withserpents on it and you're not supposedto enter the door it reminds me of thetomb of Tutankhamun which is supposed tohold curses and treasure behind it yesuh have you been to this particularTemple the one in Kerala I've been tothe outside of the temple okay yes theyhad restrictions at that time and therewas no filming inside by the way umthey're now the entire temples in themiddle of a big lawsuit why uh becausethey have found you knowa lot of gold and diamonds and treasurein the walls in the underground vaultsof this Templeuh there's one particular Vault calledVault Band they're fighting back and forth inthe court saying that it should not beopenedit should not be open at allum they've already found I don't knowhow much money they've found okay todayI think it's worth maybe billions ofdollars it could be that much moneyum founderum it had already been there so it's avery interesting story againsame thing you knowum there have been undergroundwalls that historically priests havesaid we're not supposed to open thisnobody's supposed to open this okay thisis a this is forbidden by the Godsand we have stories just like the tombof Tutankhamun right so when they openedit people fainted some people who openedthe Vault fainted they saw snakes comingoutof the world and there are it turns outit's not just one chamber when they'vethey saw one chamber and they said theyfound a huge box full of treasure andthen they found another door behind thatand then behind that and then behindthat so it just keeps on going and it'sall underground yes it's underground Ithink it's it's going as a slope insideand then there'sthere's one door they found it's nowcalled Vault B and it has a set ofintertwined nagas guarding it okay andthen the priests have said no there's noway you can open this right they'reactually saying thatif you open the door the world will cometo an end or something like this okayand of course this is now in the courtssaying that no you know we some peopleare saying we want to open it rightbecause the government is saying thatall this treasure belongs to thegovernmentright these people are saying that theywant to open it are usually the villainsin these movies yes but uh who are thepeople are trying to open it though wellthe government people who always claimright and there is a huge movement nowsaying that who actually owns thetemples right historically it may havebeen a family it may have been a kingwho owned the temples right the templesare a property of you know a particulargroupnow you know in the last 50 or 100 yearsyou can see the temples are apartof the state government for exampleright soum the government definitely wants toopen because it can bring them you knowRevenue right it brings a lot of moneyto to them how many billion dollars doyou think it is in that one Temple Idon't want to give you wrong informationbut I think it's billions and billionsof dollars so could you draw the visualat least is it like you know of swimmingpool full of gold coins at least that Ithink at least that with like diamondsyeah like random golden swords yes yesat least that because they keep openingChambers after Chambers and then wedon't know right so we're we're lookingat a door with intertwined nagas butthere may be more doors behind thatright so this may not be the end of thethe treasure right who do you think putit there and whyI mean obviously you can argue you knowtraditionally what will people say rightso they'll say oh the kings were justhoarding their Treasures right they werejust stockpiling them right this is astandard argument but no I thinkas we go deeper like a temple like justlike how I explain the temple startsfrom the base level right it starts fromthe animals and then to the art andarchitecture and then erotica you can bestuckyou can be stuck if you're you can bestuck in erotica and you cannot see theGodsso this is what they're doing they'refirst throwing you the money soyou'll be stuck in thembut as we go deeper there may be moreinformationright what if you find a map or like ablueprint for making a Vimanain the vault think about that right whatif you find Advanced Technology to buildon a spaceship or something it'spossible Right ancient Indian texts arefull of this kind of strange informationso I think maybe something is reallyvaluable right money money right whatlike what can you do with money rightwhat is the use of money if you're notgoing to build a better future right butI think the money is just a distractionwhat they're just doing is just adistraction andthe nagas guardthe underworld right you know this thenagas are guarding the the pathala Locain all ancient texts so there may beactually some have said that there thisis an entrance into the underworld rightthis is the entrance to patalu localright and we don't know what's there Imean if it can be anybody's guess maybeor maybe it's an empty room maybe it'sfull of golden diamonds maybe we haveadvanced information maybe there aremore doors that keep on going right wedon't know that but it's a very big dealit's a very very big deal unfortunatelyyou know how this works right somethingopens up in an ancient site then it getsmuddied into the court the the legalstuff and then it'll just be there for along timeit's done sopeople lose interestand then eventually the government winsof course so if you enjoyed this videomake sure you check out this playlistfor more videos just like this it's theartist
